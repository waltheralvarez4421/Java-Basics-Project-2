# Java-Beginner-Project-2

Beginner project completed during my Master's program. 

This program asks the user to input the gas in the tank, 
fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon,
and the price per a gallon of gas. It then computes the price per 100 miles 
and how far the vehicle can travel with the gas in the tank.
